## Sentiments

An app that lets you log about your day. Sometimes itâ€™s hard to know how you are feeling about something that just happened. Using natural language processing, this app will try to compute the emotion that you are expressing overall in your post. You can see posts categorized by these emotions. You can also see what other users were doing on the same day, and see the overall sentiment of everyones posts for the same time periods. Using location from browsers you will  also be able to see a map of where everyone is posting from.
